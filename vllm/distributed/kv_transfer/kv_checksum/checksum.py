"""Connector-agnostic checksums of KV cache blocks.

A checksum covers one block position of one KV cache group, over the
unsharded model (all layers of the group, all KV heads):

1. A slice is the KV of one layer and one KV head in the block: the K and V
   of the block's tokens for that head. Laid out token by token and split
   into little-endian 8-byte pieces ``x_0, x_1, ...``, its checksum is::

       s = sum_j x_j * (2 * j + 1)  mod 2**64

2. The block's checksum adds up the slices of every layer and head, each
   times its own odd factor::

       c = sum_{layer, head} m * s  mod 2**64,  m = 2 * (layer * H + head) + 1

   where ``H = MAX_KV_HEADS_PER_LAYER``, a fixed bound on any layer's KV
   heads, so that ``m`` does not depend on the model or how it is split.
   Layers are numbered by the layer number in their names and heads
   globally across TP.

Odd factors make any change to a single piece change ``c``, and distinct
factors make misplaced data (swapped tokens, heads or layers) change it too.

A slice always lies whole on one TP rank, and each worker weighs its slices
by their global layer and head, whatever its shard or memory layout. The
parts from all TP ranks and PP stages therefore sum to ``c``, and a producer
and a consumer can compare one value per (group, block position) regardless
of their TP sizes, PP sizes or KV cache layouts.

Replicated KV (MLA, or GQA with more TP ranks than KV heads) is tracked per
replica: a partial checksum is keyed by ``(replicas, replica_index)`` of the
layers it covers, so each consumer replica can be checked on its own.
